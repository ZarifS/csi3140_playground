            <p>As a software developer and student most of my projects have been done in school for either summatives or
                assignments. Some of which have been pretty fun to create and learn from. The first one I'll showcase
                would be the first game I made using programming. For my grade 12 summative I decided to recreate the
                iconic Pong game using Java and created a 2 player game with 2 difficulties, easy and hard. Through this
                project I was introduced to object oriented programming and realized how powerful it is. Some screen
                shots of the game are down below. You can also check the source code as well as actually play the game
                if you visit my <a href="https://github.com/ZarifS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
